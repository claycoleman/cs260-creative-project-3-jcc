For this lab, you will create a website that uses Vue for the front end. This website can be for anything you want, but should not be similar to the Vue apps we have already built so far. You must create your own original work. You creative projects can build on each other.

Requirements
This is a creative project, so you are welcome to build what you would like. The basic requirements are:

- [x] The site uses Vue
- [x] The site contains a footer that links to your public GitHub repository

Rubric for Grading
We will grade your projects based on:

- [x] you used Vue for the entire site
- [ ] how well you follow web design principles: spacing, typography, color, consistency, and responsive design.

TAs will assign scores in these ranges:

90-100: Excellent use of Vue, clearly follows web design principles
80-90: Uses Vue, good effort was made, but needs work to more clearly present the data or follow web design principles
70-80: Fulfills the minimum requirement of using Vue, but does not make a strong effort to use it well or follow web design principles
